* **Q:** The clightning service is running but when I try to use it (f.e. by running `lightning-cli getinfo` as user operator) all I get is `lightning-cli: Connecting to 'lightning-rpc': Connection refused`.
    * **A:** Check your clightning logs with `journalctl -eu clightning`. Do you see something like `bitcoin-cli getblock ... false` failed? Are you using pruned mode? That means that clightning hasn't seen all the blocks it needs to and it can't get that block because your node is pruned. If you're just setting up a new node you can `systemctl stop clightning` and wipe your `/var/lib/clightning` directory. Otherwise you need to reindex the Bitcoin node.
* **Q:** My disk space is getting low due to nix.
    * **A:** run `nix-collect-garbage -d`
* **Q:** Where is `sudo`???
    * **A:** we replaced sudo with OpenBSD's doas after [CVE-2021-3156](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/26/3). It has greatly reduced complexity, and is therefore less likely to be a source of severe vulnerabilities in the future.
